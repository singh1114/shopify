# shopify
Shopify APIs

For using the application you need to have a shopify account. On the shopify account you need to create one private app and get the credentials.

Use direnv to create environment variables as follows:

export PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_API_KEY='XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
export PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_PASSWORD='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
